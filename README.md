# üëª Ghostbusters ‚Ä¢ Dark Color Theme for Sublime Text

* Based on Monokai Dark, with less yellows, more minty greens üéÑ
* Just a changeset on top of the popular default theme, should look great on most languages.
* Similar to: Dracula, SynthWave 84, One Monokai 80s

üö® Install Instructions

1. Add **Ghostbusters.sublime-color-scheme** to **~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/User/**
2. Rename to **Monokai.sublime-color-scheme**
3. Preferences -> Select Color Scheme -> Monokai

‚ò¢Ô∏è These funky installation steps are required because Sublime Text 4 does not yet support color scheme extensions!
